Until recently Evgeny was a CTO of a [Chinese cruise booking platform](https://www.ylly.com/) taking an offline traditional travel agency business to become a software business. And now he's a CTO of a recruitment company taking it through a similar transformation.

He's also the organizer of the [Beijing Python Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Beijing-Python/).

## Takeaways

### Automation helps to reduce costs

By automating parts of your business flow while still keeping a "human in the loop" you can make your business model more scalable and grow your volume without increasing headcount in operations.

### Digital products help to engage customers

Especially in the younger demographics, customers like to "self-serve" and use software to solve their needs rather than traditional ways.

### Analytics help to make data-driven business decisions

Making the software core of a business and instrumenting it with event tracking and metrics allows the business to be data-driven, make better decisions and be competitive.
