# **Automate**

## Automation helps to **reduce costs**

* Manual processes are not scalable
* Computers are much cheaper and better at certain tasks than humans
* Keep the "human in the loop"

^ By automating parts of your business flow while still keeping a "human in the loop"
you can make your business model more scalable and grow your volume without increasing headcount in operations.

# Power to the **customer**

## Digital products help to **engage** customers

* Modern customers like to "self-serve"
* Customer preferences/priorities:
  1. self-serve
  2. chat with a bot/person
  3. deal with someone on a phone/email/in person

^ Especially in the younger demographics, customers like to "self-serve"
and use software to solve their needs rather than traditional ways.

# Build-**Measure**-Learn

## Analytics help to make **data-driven** business decisions

* Instrument your software with metrics/event tracking
* Measure the "funnel"
* Make your assumptions explicit
* Validate your assumptions
* Act on the real data

^ Making the software core of a business and instrumenting it with event tracking and metrics
allows the business to be data-driven, make better decisions and be competitive.
